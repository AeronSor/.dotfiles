Personal dotfiles for my Arch-Linux bspwm setup ðŸ˜Ž

[ UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

<b>Dependencies</b>

Don't forget to enable multilib on your pacman.conf

Pacman: 
```
sudo pacman -S --needed -<~/.dotfiles/dependencies/core.txt
```

yay: 
```
yay -S $(cat ~/.dotfiles/dependencies/core_aur.txt |xargs) --needed
```
I am just storing a list of dependencies for now, because I don't know
a better way to keep track of them o(Tãƒ˜To), if you do, let me know ;)
(I might write a script to handle just that in the future)
